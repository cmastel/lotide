# Lotide

The Lotide project is inspired by the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) project, which is a utility library for Javascript.

The Lotide project is a modular collection of functions that operate on data, namely Arrays and Objects.

### Goals of Creating Lotide
- Become more comfortable with FOCAL (Functions, Objects, Conditionals, Arrays, Loops)
- Writing modular code
- Automated testing
- Using industry standard testing function such as [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
- Software dependencies
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Ultimately publishing the Lodite project through npm
